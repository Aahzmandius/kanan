# kanan
Mods for Mabinogi using Javascript

## Instructions
1. Download Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
2. While installing it make sure you check the box that says **Add Python 3.x to
PATH**
3. To make sure Python was installed correctly, open a command prompt and type
`python --version` and you should get a response.
4. Start Mabinogi.
5. Run the batch file `kanan.bat` as an adminstrator.

## Things to be aware of
By default every script (mod) that comes with kanan is enabled by default. To 
disable a mod go into the `./scripts/` directory and delete it, or add the 
name of the feature (BitmapFont for example) to `disabled.txt`.
